# Plant_disease_prediction_model
This model will detect whether a plant (from the given 3 classes) is suffering from any kind of a disease or not. This model will help farmers know about the condition of the crops at an early stage, so that they can take the necessary decisions and prevent wastage of food for our over growing population.
