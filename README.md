# Plant_disease_prediction_model

Abstract Overview :

This model will detect whether a plant (from the given 3 classes) is suffering from any kind of a disease or not. This model will help farmers know about the condition of the crops at an early stage, so that they can take the necessary decisions and prevent wastage of food for our over growing population.

This model is based on the scope of the development of MOBILE DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS through Machine Learning and Big Data. With the rapid growing population of this planet, there'll be a gradual increase in food production. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% (approx). Whereas there are situations where many farmers in our developing world have to face 100% yield losses sometimes.

And at the same time due to the widespread growth in the amount of smartphone owners across the rich and the poor depicts that their is potential to turn the smartphones into a very useful and efficient tool for those who put all of their efforts in yielding crops in order to feed the world.

This model is just an execution of the above ideology on a much smaller scale.

# About the Dataset :
Here I have taken and worked with an open source dataset consisting of 3 classes of crops which have infectious symptoms on them. The classes are as follows :

- Corn (suffering from common rust)
- Potato (suffering from early blight)
- Tomato (suffering from Bacterial spot)

# Regarding ipynb file :
- If you're using *Google Colab* then change dataset folder path while mounting the drive.
- If you're using any other platform like Microsoft VS Code, Jupyter Notebook etc then simply open the ipynb file.
